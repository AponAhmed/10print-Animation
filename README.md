# Canvas Element Animation

A simple canvas element animation created using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. This animation features randomly generated lines that change direction upon reaching the canvas boundaries.

## 10Print Algorithm

This animation draws inspiration from the famous 10Print algorithm, a one-liner BASIC program that creates an intricate maze-like pattern by randomly printing either a forward slash ("/") or a backslash ("\"). The simplicity of the algorithm and the complexity of the resulting patterns have made it a popular subject in the world of creative coding.

The concept is straightforward: for each iteration, randomly choose between a forward slash and a backslash, and repeat the process in a grid formation. The outcome is a mesmerizing visual pattern, and variations of the algorithm have been explored in different programming languages.
